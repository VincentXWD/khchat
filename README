Here's an open source chat tool written by golang based in TCP protocol. The features are not complete. I'm completing it. Just wait a few days :)
Usage:
	Server:
		./go run server.go [PORT]
	Client:
		./go run client.go [IP:PORT]
In this version, you must use the real IP address in client. For example:
./go run server.go 6666
./go run client.go 222.211.38.41:6666 (Do NOT use localhost:6666 or 127.0.0.1:6666)
